GitHub is a web-based platform that combines Git version control with 
collaboration and project management features. It facilitates 
collaboration and version control in the following ways:

- Version Control:
GitHub allows developers to host and manage Git 
repositories online. This makes it easy to track changes to code, 
collaborate with others, and maintain a complete history of a project.

- Collaboration:
Developers can work together on projects by forking 
repositories, making changes, and then creating pull requests to 
propose their changes to the original project. This enables a 
structured and efficient way to review and merge contributions.

- Issue Tracking:
GitHub provides tools for issue tracking and project 
management, allowing teams to manage tasks, track bugs, and plan 
project milestones.

- Code Review:
It offers features for code review, such as comments 
and code discussion threads, making it easier to collaborate and 
maintain code quality.

- Continuous Integration:
GitHub integrates with various continuous 
integration and deployment (CI/CD) tools, automating testing and 
deployment workflows.

- Community and Social Coding:
GitHub has a large and active developer 
community, making it easy for developers to discover, contribute to, 
and learn from other open-source projects.
