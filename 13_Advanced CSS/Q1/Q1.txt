The var() function in CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to define
and apply custom properties or custom variables within your
stylesheets. These variables can store values that you want to reuse
throughout your CSS code, making it easier to maintain and update your
design. The primary purposes of using the var() function in CSS are as
follows:


- Reusability: By defining custom variables, you can store values that 
are used repeatedly in your styles, such as colors, font sizes, 
spacing, or any other property value. This makes your code more 
modular and easier to update, as you can change a value in one place 
(the variable declaration) and have it automatically update throughout 
your styles.

- Consistency: Custom variables help maintain design consistency across 
your website or application. When you use the same variable for a 
specific value, it ensures that all instances of that value are 
consistent, making it easier to create a cohesive design.

- Maintainability: If you need to change a design element, you can 
update the value of a custom variable once, and that change will 
propagate to all elements that use that variable. This reduces the 
risk of errors and saves time compared to manually updating each 
instance of a value.
