Flexbox VS Grid:

The primary difference between CSS Grid and Flexbox lies in their
layout dimensions. CSS Grid is designed for two-dimensional layouts,
allowing control over both rows and columns simultaneously. It enables
explicit placement of items within specific grid cells, providing 
global control over the entire grid container. On the other hand, 
Flexbox is tailored for one-dimensional layouts, focusing on arranging 
items in a single row or column. It facilitates implicit placement based
on the source code order, with local control over item alignment 
and distribution along the main and cross axes of a flex container. In 
summary, while Grid is suitable for complex layouts requiring both 
rows and columns, Flexbox excels in component layouts and responsive 
designs with a one-dimensional structure.


When to Use Flexbox:

- When dealing with one-dimensional layouts, such as navigation bars,
lists, or a series of items in a row or column.

- When you need flexibility in the arrangement of items and want to 
control the alignment and distribution of space along the main and 
cross axes.

When to Use Grid:

- When you have a more complex layout with both rows and columns, such as a full-page
layout or a design that involves a grid-based structure.

- When you need precise control over the placement of items in both dimensions.

- When working with larger-scale layouts and aiming for a more grid-based design approach.

Choosing Between Flexbox and Grid:

- Use Flexbox: For one-dimensional layouts or when dealing with items in a row or column.

- Use Grid: For two-dimensional layouts, especially when you need precise control over both rows and columns.

- Combine Them: In many cases, you might find it beneficial to use both Flexbox and Grid in combination.
For example, you might use Flexbox to arrange items within a grid cell or Grid for the overall page layout
and Flexbox for the components inside the grid.
