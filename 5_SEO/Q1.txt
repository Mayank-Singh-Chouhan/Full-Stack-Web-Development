visibility in search engine results pages for specific keywords and phrases.The goal of SEO is
to increase organic (non-paid) traffic to a website by ranking higher in search engine results for relevant queries.
SEO involves a variety of strategies and techniques to enhance a website's content and structure to make it more appealing
to search engines like Google, Bing, and Yahoo.


Why it's important ?

1. Improved Visibility: SEO helps your website appear at or near the top of search engine results for relevant keywords.
This increased visibility can attract more visitors to your site.

2. Increased Organic Traffic: Higher search engine rankings lead to more organic traffic, which
means visitors who are actively looking for the products, services, or information your website offers.

3. Credibility and Trust: Websites that rank highly in search results are often perceived as more
credible and trustworthy by users. People tend to trust search engines and believe that top-ranking
sites are more legitimate and authoritative.

4. Better User Experience: SEO involves optimizing your website for both search engines and users. This can 
lead to improvements in site speed, mobile-friendliness, and overall user experience, which can reduce bounce 
rates and keep visitors engaged.

5. Cost-Effective Marketing: Compared to paid advertising, SEO can be a cost-effective long-term strategy for
driving traffic. Once your site ranks well, you don't have to pay for each click.
