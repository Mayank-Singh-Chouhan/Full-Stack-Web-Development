Here are some of the key benefits of using meta tags:

mproved SEO: Meta tags, particularly the "meta description" and "meta keywords" tags (although the latter is 
less relevant today), can help improve a webpage's search engine ranking. Search engines use the information 
in these tags to understand the content and relevance of the page, which can lead to better visibility in search results.

Better User Experience: The "meta description" tag, in particular, provides a concise and informative summary of
the page's content. This summary is often displayed in search engine results, helping users understand what the
page is about before clicking on it. A well-crafted meta description can attract more relevant visitors and improve
click-through rates.

Information Organization: Meta tags can help organize and categorize information about a webpage. For example,
meta tags like "meta name="author"" and "meta name="copyright"" can attribute content to its author and specify
copyright information.

Localization: Meta tags, like "meta name="language"" and "meta name="geo.placename"", allow you to specify the
language and geographic location of a webpage, making it more relevant to specific audiences.

Accessibility: Meta tags like "meta name="viewport"" can optimize the presentation of your web page on various devices
and screen sizes, enhancing accessibility and user experience across different platforms.
