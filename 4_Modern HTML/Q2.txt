HTML entities are special codes or sequences of characters used to represent characters that have
a specific meaning or might not be displayed correctly if entered directly into an HTML document.
These entities are especially useful for characters with reserved meanings in HTML, such as angle 
brackets (< and >), quotation marks, and special symbols.

Here are five commonly used HTML entities:

&lt; - Represents the less-than symbol <.
&gt; - Represents the greater-than symbol >.
&amp; - Represents the ampersand symbol &.
&copy; - Represents the copyright symbol ©.
&reg; - Represents the registered trademark symbol ®.
