that mandate web accessibility for public and private sector websites. Non-compliance can result in legal consequences.

Ethical Responsibility: Ensuring that everyone can access and benefit from digital content is 
an ethical responsibility for businesses and organizations.

Expanded Audience: By making your website accessible, you expand your potential audience, including people with 
disabilities who might otherwise be excluded.

SEO Benefits: Search engines reward accessible websites with improved rankings because accessibility often leads
to better user experience and well-structured content.

Hearing Impairments: Captions and transcripts for multimedia content ensure that deaf and hard of hearing users can access the same information as everyone else.
