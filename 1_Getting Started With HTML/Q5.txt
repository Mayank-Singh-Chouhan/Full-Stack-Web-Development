The DOCTYPE declaration in HTML is a small line of code placed at the beginning of an HTML document.
Its purpose is to specifythe type and version of HTML being used on the webpage. It helps web browsers 
understand how to interpret and render the content correctly.

Here's a simple example of a DOCTYPE declaration for HTML5:

<!DOCTYPE html>

In this case, <!DOCTYPE html> tells the browser that the webpage is written in HTML5, the latest version of HTML.
