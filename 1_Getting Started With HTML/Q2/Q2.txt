Comments in HTML serve the purpose of providing explanatory or descriptive information within the
 code that is not displayed in the web browser when the page is rendered. They are primarily intended
for developers, designers, or anyone working on the HTML document to understand the code better,
add notes, or temporarily disable parts of the code without deleting them. Comments are
ignored by web browsers and do not affect the appearance or functionality of the web
page.
