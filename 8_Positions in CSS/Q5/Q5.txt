z-index:

The z-index property in CSS is used to control the stacking order of positioned elements.
Elements with a higher z-index value are stacked above elements with lower values. If two
elements have the same z-index, the one that comes later in the HTML or is last in the document 
order will be stacked above.

In this example, we have two absolutely positioned boxes (#box1 and #box2). The z-index property 
is used to control their stacking order. The red box (#box1) has a higher z-index value than the
blue box (#box2). Therefore, #box1 will be stacked above #box2.
