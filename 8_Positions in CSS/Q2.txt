Absolute Positioning:

- When you set an element to have an absolute position, it is positioned relative to its closest positioned (not static) ancestor element.
- If there is no positioned ancestor, it is positioned relative to the initial containing block (usually the <html> element).
- The element is taken out of the normal flow of the document, meaning it doesn't affect the position of other elements.
- The positioning is then done using the top, right, bottom, and left properties.

.absolute-positioned {
  position: absolute;
  top: 20px;
  left: 30px;
}

Relative Positioning:

- When you set an element to have a relative position, it is positioned relative to its normal position in the document flow.
- It still occupies space in the normal flow, but you can then adjust its position using the offset properties (top, right, bottom, left).
- Other elements on the page will be positioned as if the element still took up its normal space.

.relative-positioned {
  position: relative;
  top: 10px;
  left: 20px;
}


- Absolute positioning:  takes the element out of the normal flow and positions it relative to its closest positioned ancestor or the initial containing block.
- Relative positioning:  adjusts the position of an element relative to its normal position in the document flow, and it still occupies space in the normal flow.
